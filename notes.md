- `authService` is a fake authentication service.
- `ProtectedRoute` is a wrapper component that conditionally renders `Component` and `Redirect`.
- Login and Logout buttons are also rendered conditionally.
- After logging out gibberish in the console, I found out that all of the routes are re-rendered, everytime the URL changes.
- Login and Logout buttons are displayed/hidden upon each re-rendering of `<BrowserRouter />`.
- `withRouter` (HoC) lets normal components access the `history`, `loaction` and `match` objects.
- `to` props takes either a path (string) or an object of signature `{ pathname: '', state: {...} }`
